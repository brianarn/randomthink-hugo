# RandomThink.net, Hugo style

Decided to play a bit with [Hugo][] as a replacement for Jekyll/Octopress.

Pros:

- The installation is simply `brew install hugo` - no dependency junk (until I decide to turn on Pygments)
- It seems SUPER fast

Cons:

- I have no idea how to make a website pretty. I mean, have you seen my blog? It's pretty awful. This isn't going to be better.

Still, good to try something.
